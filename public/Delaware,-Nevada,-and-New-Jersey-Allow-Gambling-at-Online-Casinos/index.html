<p>The Delaware Council on Gambling Problems reports that in the first half of 2017, internet gambling brought in $3.8 million in revenue, up from $3.2 million in the first half of 2016. In the first six months of this year, the state netted $1.7 million in taxes from its three regulated internet gambling sites. That’s a big jump from the first six months of last year, when it pulled in just $1 million.</p>
<p>In Nevada, internet gambling generated about $9.8 million in revenue during its first seven months of operation. That’s on top of the state’s $317 million in land-based casino gaming winnings during that same period, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>New Jersey took in nearly $20 million from online gambling during its first nine months of operation, according to The Associated Press. Garden State lawmakers say they expect online casino revenues to reach $200 million annually within five years.</p>
<p>Legalizing online gambling has been seen as a way to help states bolster their coffers during tough economic times. It has also been viewed as a means of keeping people gambling within regulated jurisdictions rather than risk wagers with offshore operators operating in gray areas of the law.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Joins-List-of-States-Allowing-Gambling-at-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Joins-List-of-States-Allowing-Gambling-at-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Joins List of States Allowing Gambling at Online Casinos"></a>Pennsylvania Joins List of States Allowing Gambling at Online Casinos</h1><p>On Tuesday, October 17th, 2017, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed a bill into law legalizing gambling at online casinos in the state. This makes Pennsylvania the fourth US state to allow gambling at online casinos, joining New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.</p>
<p>The bill authorizes the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) to issue licenses to casinos wishing to offer online gambling. It also sets regulations for how online gambling will be conducted in the state.</p>
<p>In order to gamble at an online casino in Pennsylvania, residents must be at least 21 years old. They must also be physically located within the state boundaries when they are gambling. Online casinos cannot offer games to Pennsylvania residents if they are located outside of the state.</p>
<p>The law states that all taxes and fees generated by online gambling will be used to support senior citizens’ services and education programs in the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more problem gambling, but supporters believe that it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-to-Allow-Gambling-at-Online-Casinos"><a href="#West-Virginia-to-Allow-Gambling-at-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia to Allow Gambling at Online Casinos"></a>West Virginia to Allow Gambling at Online Casinos</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The state of West Virginia is preparing to legalize gambling at online casinos.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise to many, as the state has been hesitant to legalize any form of gambling in the past.</p>
<p>According to reports, the move is an effort to help the state’s struggling budget. Gambling revenues are expected to bring in around $100 million per year.</p>
<p>Governor Jim Justice made the announcement on Wednesday, saying that the move would help create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue. He also said that the decision had been cleared by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Justice went on to say that he hoped other states would follow West Virginia’s lead and legalize gambling as well.</p>
<p>West Virginia is not the only state to consider legalizing online gambling in recent months. Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Michigan have all been exploring similar options.</p>
<h1 id="More-States-Considering-Legislation-to-Allow-Gambling-at-Online-Casinos"><a href="#More-States-Considering-Legislation-to-Allow-Gambling-at-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="More States Considering Legislation to Allow Gambling at Online Casinos"></a>More States Considering Legislation to Allow Gambling at Online Casinos</h1><p>The legalization of online gambling continues to make progress in the United States with more states considering legislation that would allow residents to gamble on the internet.</p>
<p>This week, the Utah House of Representatives approved a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling within the state. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.</p>
<p>If passed, Utah would become the ninth state to legalize some form of online gambling.</p>
<p>Other states currently considering similar legislation include Indiana, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and California.</p>
<p>Proponents of online gambling argue that it is a way to generate new revenue for states, while opponents argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-and-Illinois-Take-Next-Steps-Toward-Legalizing-Gambling-at-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Connecticut-and-Illinois-Take-Next-Steps-Toward-Legalizing-Gambling-at-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut and Illinois Take Next Steps Toward Legalizing Gambling at Online Casinos"></a>Connecticut and Illinois Take Next Steps Toward Legalizing Gambling at Online Casinos</h1><p>In Connecticut and Illinois, lawmakers are taking the next steps towards legalizing gambling at online casinos. In Connecticut, the House of Representatives recently voted in favor of a bill that would legalize and regulate online casinos in the state. The bill now moves on to the Senate for further consideration.</p>
<p>In Illinois, a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling was approved by the Senate Gaming Committee. The bill now moves on to the full Senate for a vote. If approved, it would then move on to the House for further consideration.</p>
<p>Both bills would allow residents in their respective states to gamble online at licensed and regulated casino sites. The bills would also tax gambling revenues from these sites.</p>
<p> supporters of legalizing online gambling argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for state governments, while opponents argue that it could lead to increased addiction and other negative consequences.</p>

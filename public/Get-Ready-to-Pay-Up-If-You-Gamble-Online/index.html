Whether you’re playing casino games, betting on sports, or buying lottery tickets, you could end up spending a lot of money if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>If you’re new to gambling online, here are some tips to help you avoid losing too much money:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose. This is especially important if you’re gambling for entertainment purposes rather than to make money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do your research before choosing an online casino. Make sure the site is reputable and has a good reputation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stick to games that you know how to play. This will help reduce the chances of making costly mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set a budget and stick to it. Decide how much money you’re willing to spend on gambling each day, week, or month and don’t exceed that amount.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take breaks from gambling regularly. This will help prevent burnout and keep your bankroll healthy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of the odds before placing a bet. If the odds are not in your favour, it’s usually not worth betting on that outcome.</p>

Owners of the 12 casinos in the state have hired a lobbyist and threatened to sue if legislation allowing online gambling is passed.</p>
<p>The casinos are arguing that online gambling will cannibalize their business, since gamblers will be able to gamble from their homes instead of making the trip to a casino. They also argue that it will be hard to regulate and that minors will be able to gamble illegally.</p>
<p>Governor Chris Christie has already indicated his support for online gambling and says that the regulatory framework for it is already in place. He has argued that the casinos have nothing to fear from online gambling, since it will only cannibalize a small portion of their business.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the casino owners can stop online gambling from coming to New Jersey, but they are certainly mounting a strong fight.</p>
<h1 id="Bill-to-Ban-Online-Gambling-Introduced-in-House"><a href="#Bill-to-Ban-Online-Gambling-Introduced-in-House" class="headerlink" title="Bill to Ban Online Gambling Introduced in House"></a>Bill to Ban Online Gambling Introduced in House</h1><p>A bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives that would ban all forms of online gambling, including poker.</p>
<p>The measure, which is sponsored by Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, would make it illegal for banks and other financial institutions to process any transactions related to online gambling.</p>
<p>This would effectively shut down the entire industry, as most players currently use credit cards or other banking methods to fund their accounts.</p>
<p>The bill is being opposed by a number of powerful lobbying groups, including the Poker Players Alliance and the American Gaming Association.</p>
<p>They argue that the measure will do more harm than good, and will deprive states of much-needed tax revenue.</p>
<p>There is also concern that the bill will lead to increased crime and addictive behavior.</p>
<p>Representative Chaffetz counters that the bill will help protect children and vulnerable adults from being scammed or exploited by gambling websites.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Governor-Signs-Bill-Authorizing-State-Regulated-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Governor-Signs-Bill-Authorizing-State-Regulated-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Governor Signs Bill Authorizing State-Regulated Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Governor Signs Bill Authorizing State-Regulated Online Gambling</h1><p>On June 13, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed Assembly Bill No. 114, authorizing the state to license and regulate online gambling. The governor had announced his intention to sign the bill on May 31.</p>
<p>AB 114 allows for online poker, casino games and mobile sports betting. Under its provisions, the Nevada Gaming Commission will be responsible for regulating online gambling operations, while the Nevada Gaming Control Board will have oversight of digital platforms and technological standards.</p>
<p>In a statement released following the signing of AB 114, Governor Sandoval said: “This is a historic day for the State of Nevada. I am grateful to the legislature for their hard work in crafting this bill and to my team for their support in getting it across the finish line. I also want to thank our gaming industry partners who have been essential in getting us to this point. I look forward to working with them as we implement this new industry and create thousands of jobs.”</p>
<p>Nevada is now the fifth US state to authorize regulated online gambling, joining New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Operators in those states must partner with a licensed land-based casino in order to offer online gambling services.</p>
<p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has already begun work on regulations governing online gambling operations, with a draft expected to be released by the end of summer. The first licenses are anticipated to be issued in early 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Nevada-and-New-Jersey-Finalize-Deals-for-Interstate-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Nevada-and-New-Jersey-Finalize-Deals-for-Interstate-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey Finalize Deals for Interstate Online Gambling"></a>Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey Finalize Deals for Interstate Online Gambling</h1><p>On October 10, 2018, Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey finalized deals for interstate online gambling. The three states have been working on the deal for over a year.</p>
<p>Now that the deals are finalized, each state will be able to offer its own online casino games, poker, and sports betting. The only limitation is that players must be physically located in their home state in order to play.</p>
<p>For Nevada and Delaware, this is the next step in their plan to offer regulated online gambling. For New Jersey, it means that they can now offer in-state betting on NFL and college football games.</p>
<p>The deals were made possible by the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year in the Murphy vs. NCAA case. That ruling struck down the federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>Since then, a number of states have started to legalize sports betting within their borders. But New Jersey was the first state to offer full-scale online sports betting.</p>
<p>With the new interstate agreement in place, New Jersey can now offer its services to residents of Delaware and Nevada. In turn, residents of Delaware and Nevada will be able to place bets on New Jersey sporting events.</p>
<p>There is still some work to be done before the agreement goes into effect. Each state has to pass legislation approving it. Then each state needs to create an agreement outlining how the partnership will work.</p>
<p>But assuming everything goes according to plan, players in all three states should be able to start placing bets by early 2019.</p>

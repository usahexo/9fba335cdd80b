#  Poker hands are equally likely – so don't get upset when you don't win every time!

In poker, we are constantly reminded that each hand is unique, and that the odds of any given combination of cards coming up are equal. This is a comforting thought, as it means that we can't really be "due" for a win – no matter how often we may seem to come up short.

Of course, this doesn't mean that poker is a game of pure chance. There is still plenty of skill involved in playing well and maximizing our chances of winning. But it's important to remember that no hand is ever a sure thing, and even the best player can lose on any given day.

So the next time you're feeling frustrated about your latest poker game, remember that the hands are equally likely – and stay calm and collected! You never know when your next win might be just around the corner.

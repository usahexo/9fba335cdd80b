#  Yahoo and Google Pay Casino Real Madrid CF Extends Its Sponsorship

Yahoo and Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc. have agreed to pay Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid CF an undisclosed sum for the club’s sponsorship, reports Reuters. The deal is said to be for a period of four years starting from this season.

This new agreement follows on from the successful one that was in place between 2014 and 2017. In that time, Yahoo and Google each paid €35 million per season for the naming rights to the Santiago Bernabéu stadium, which is home to Real Madrid CF.

According to José Ángel Sánchez, the club’s president, this latest agreement demonstrates the great potential that still exists in Spain for these two companies. He also believes that it will be very beneficial for both Real Madrid CF and its fans.

It is not yet clear what exactly Yahoo and Google plan to do with their sponsorship of the Spanish soccer giant. However, it is expected that they will use it as a way to improve their image and increase brand awareness amongst Spanish-speaking consumers around the world.

#  Sponsorship Deal Puts Yahoo and Google in the Champions League of Advertising

When two of the biggest advertising sponsors in the world team up, it is big news. That is what happened this week when Yahoo and Google announced a new sponsorship deal that will see the two companies team up to become the exclusive global sponsors of the Champions League, Europe’s top soccer competition.

The new deal means that Yahoo and Google will now be able to promote their brands and products on a global stage by becoming the title sponsor of one of the most prestigious tournaments in world soccer. The move is also seen as a way for Yahoo and Google to bolster their rivalry in the online advertising market.

The agreement between Yahoo and Google was announced by UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, on Monday. As part of the deal, both Yahoo and Google will have their branding displayed on all Champions League matches, as well as being given exclusive rights to market Champions League-related content on their respective websites. Financial terms of the deal were not released, but it is thought to be worth millions of dollars.

The sponsorship agreement comes at a time when UEFA is looking to increase its revenues from marketing deals. The organization has been hit hard by the global financial crisis, with its overall income dropping by 26 percent between 2007 and 2011. Sponsorship deals like this one are seen as being key to helping UEFA boost its finances in the future.

For Yahoo and Google, teaming up to become sponsors of Europe’s top soccer competition is seen as a way to further strengthen their bond in the online advertising market. Both companies are locked in a battle for supremacy in this market, with Yahoo recently launching a new advertising campaign called “It’s You Time” which targets small businesses.

Google has responded to this challenge by ramping up its efforts to attract more small businesses to its AdWords platform. The company recently launched a new program called “AdWords for Startups” which offers free access to its advertising services for qualifying businesses.

It is expected that Yahoo and Google will use their new sponsorship deal as an opportunity to tout the benefits of their respective advertising platforms to small businesses around the world. With Champions League matches being broadcast in more than 200 countries, this could be a very lucrative market for both companies.

#  Champions League Clubs Now Accepting Yahoo and Google Pay for Sponsorships

The Champions League, Europe's top-tier football tournament, has announced that it will now be accepting sponsorships from Yahoo and Google. The decision comes as a result of the increasing popularity of both companies in Europe.

A spokesperson for the Champions League stated that "both Yahoo and Google have become major players in the European market, and we believe that their sponsorship will help us to reach even more fans across the continent."

Yahoo and Google are both expected to pay millions of euros for the privilege of being Champions League sponsors. In return, they will be given advertising space on TV broadcasts and official Champions League merchandise.

The news was welcomed by both companies, who see it as an opportunity to increase their visibility in Europe. "This is a great opportunity for us to build on our already strong presence in Europe," said a spokesperson for Yahoo.

Google echoed these sentiments, saying that "the Champions League is one of the most popular sporting events in Europe, and we're excited to be involved."

#  Yahoo and Google Strikes Another Major Sponsorship Deal, This Time with Spanish Soccer Club

This week, Spanish soccer giant FC Barcelona announced a landmark new sponsorship deal with Yahoo and Google. The deal is reportedly worth in the ballpark of $280 million and will run for four years. It's the latest in a series of big sponsorship deals for both Yahoo and Google, as they battle for supremacy in the online advertising market.

For Yahoo, the FC Barcelona sponsorship is a key part of its global expansion strategy. The company has been working hard to build out its international presence, and this deal gives it a major presence in Spain and Latin America. For Google, the sponsorship is another sign that it is serious about competing with Yahoo in the online advertising market.

The FC Barcelona sponsorship is also a major win for YouTube. For years, YouTube has been trying to break into the Spanish-speaking market, but has had limited success. This deal gives YouTube a significant foothold in that market.

The FC Barcelona sponsorship deal is also good news for fans of Spanish soccer. With Yahoo and Google both throwing their weight behind FC Barcelona, the club should have even more money to spend on players and facilities. And that should lead to even more exciting games and championships from one of the world's top soccer clubs.

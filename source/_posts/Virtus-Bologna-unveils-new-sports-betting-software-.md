#  How to create a sports betting software 

In this article, we will show you how to create a sports betting software. 

First, you need to create a table that will store all the data about the games. The table should have the following fields:

- id (int) - game_id (int) -home_team (string) -away_team (string) -type (enum) -date (date) -time (time) -odds (float)

The id field is used to uniquely identify each game, while the game_id field points to the row in the table. The home_team and away_team fields store the names of the teams playing in the game. The type field can have one of three values: "football", "baseball", or " basketball". The date and time fields store the date and time of the game, respectively. Finally, the odds field stores the odds of each team winning. 

Now that we have our table set up, let's write some code to insert data into it. We'll use Python for this example:

import datetime as dt import pandas as pd def add_game(game): """ Add a new game to the table. :param game: A Pandas dataframe with information about a game. :return: None """ cur = pd.connect('mysql://username:password@localhost/database') cursor = cur.cursor() try: cursor.execute("INSERT INTO `games` (`id`, `game_id`, `home_team`, `away_team`, `type`, `date`, `time`, `odds`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)") except: print("Error adding game") finally: cur.close() return def update_game(game): """ Update information about an existing game in the table. :param game: A Pandas dataframe with information about a game. :return: None """ cur = pd.connect('mysql://username:password@localhost/database') cursor = cur.cursor() try: cursor.execute("UPDATE `games` SET `home_team`=?, `away_team`=?, `type`=?, `date`=?, `time`=?, `odds`=?) WHERE ID=?") except: print("Error updating game") finally: cur.close() return def get_game(id): """ Get information about a particular game from the table. :param id: The ID of the desired game. :return: A Pandas dataframe with information about the given game.""" cur = pd.connect('mysql://username:password@localhost/database') cursor = cur.cursor() try: results = cursor . execute ("SELECT * FROM games WHERE ID=?", id). fetchall () except KeyboardInterrupt : print("Quitting") finally : cur . close () return results def main(): add_game(pd . DataFrame({ "id": 1, "game_id": 2, "home_team": "49ers", "away_team": "Packers", "type": "football", "date": dt . date ( 2020 , 1 , 24 ), "time": dt . time ( 22 , 30 ), "odds" : 3 })) add_game(pd . DataFrame({ "id": 2, "game_id": 3, "home_team": "Steelers", "away_team": "Chargers", "type": "football", "date": dt . date ( 2020 , 1 , 25 ), "time": dt . time ( 16 , 00 ), "odds" : 2 })) update _game(pd . DataFrame({ "_data":{" home _ team":" Cowboys ", away _ team":"Redskins" }},{" id" :3," type":" football"," date":" 2020- 01- 26"," time":"13"," odds":" EVEN"})) get _game(1 ) Titles are generally centered ~~ ## How to Create Sports Betting Software  In this article we ll show you how to create a sports betting software using python While we won t be going over all of Python here we will give you enough to get started & You can find more info on Python at python org  What You Ll Need First some basic knowledge of Python or some other programming language & Some MySQL experience is also helpful but not necessary as we ll primarily be using Pandas here  What We Ll Do In this tutorial we ll first create a table that will store all our data then use Python code to input and update data After that we ll write some functions to query and return data Finally we ll put it all together in a working program Lets Get Started 1 First create a new file called sportsbettingsoftware py

#  Creating a sports betting software

The sports betting industry is a multi-billion dollar industry that is growing rapidly. The global online sports betting market was estimated to be worth $37.91 billion in 2017. This number is expected to grow to $52.96 billion by 2020.

Sports betting is a popular pastime for many people. There are many different ways to bet on sports, including but not limited to:

*Point Spread
-This is the most common type of bet in American sports betting. The point spread is a number assigned to a team by the bookmaker which represents the margin of victory they need to cover in order to win the bet. For example, if the Atlanta Hawks are playing the Boston Celtics and the point spread is +7 for Atlanta, this means that Boston must lose by more than 7 points for Atlanta to win the bet. If Boston wins or loses by less than 7 points, then the person who placed the bet on Atlanta would lose money.

*Moneyline-A moneyline bet is simply wagering on who will win the game outright, regardless of the point spread. So, if you think Boston will beat Atlanta outright, you would wager on Boston moneyline -140 (meaning you would have to wager $140 to win $100). If you think Atlanta will beat Boston outright, you would wager on Atlanta moneyline +120 (meaning you would have to wager $100 to win $120).

*Totals-A totals bet is simply betting on whether or not the total score of both teams combined will be over or under a certain number set by the bookmaker. So, for example, if the bookmaker sets the total at 203 points and you think it will be over 204 points, then you would wager on over. If you think it will be under 203 points, then you would wager on under.

*Futures-A futures bet is when a person bets on a team or player to win an event that takes place in the future. For example, someone may place a futures bet on Tiger Woods winning The Masters next year.

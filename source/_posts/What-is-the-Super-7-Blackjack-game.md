#  What is the Super 7 Blackjack game?

The Super 7 Blackjack game is an interesting and exciting variation of the traditional blackjack game. The Super 7 game adds an extra betting opportunity to the mix that could see you walk away with a potentially bigger payday.

In Super 7 blackjack, the player is given seven cards at the beginning of the game. They must then choose two of those cards to keep, discarding the other five. The dealer then does the same, revealing their two cards. The player then bets on either the dealer’s hand or their own, as normal.

If the player beats the dealer with their two cards, they win regardless of what the dealer’s hand is. If the dealer beats the player, they lose regardless of what their hand is. If both hands are equal, it is a push and no one wins or loses money.

The exciting part of Super 7 blackjack comes with the three bonus options that are available on certain hands. If the player gets an Ace and a six as their first two cards (Aces can be counted as 1 or 11), they can choose to bet on another card being drawn from either deck for a potential payout of 11:1. If they get two sevens as their first two cards, they can choose to bet on another card being drawn from either deck for a potential payout of 21:1. Finally, if they get three sevens as their first three cards, they can choose to bet on another card being drawn from either deck for a potential payout of 31:1.

While these bonus bets carry more risk (as your chances of winning are lower), they also offer significantly higher payouts if you do manage to win them. So if you’re looking for an added excitement in your blackjack games, Super 7 could be just what you’re looking for!

#  What are the odds of winning in Super 7 Blackjack?

Casinos always try to lure in customers with the promise of big payouts, and blackjack is no exception. The allure of winning a large sum of money with little effort is hard for many people to resist. But how likely is it really to win big playing blackjack?

The odds of winning in Super 7 blackjack vary depending on the casino you’re playing at, but they generally range from about 1 in 35 to 1 in 45. So the odds are not great, but they’re not terrible either. If you want to increase your chances of winning, you can learn some basic blackjack strategy and play conservatively.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the house always has an edge in blackjack, no matter how good of a player you are. So don’t expect to win every time you play. Just think of it as another form of entertainment, and be happy if you walk away with a modest profit.

#  How do you play Super 7 Blackjack?

Super 7 Blackjack is a blackjack variant that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The game is played with the usual objective of getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

The game begins by the player being dealt two cards face up. The dealer is then dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. The face down card is called the hole card.

The player then has the option of either taking another card (hit) or sticking with their current total (stand). If the player busts by going over 21, they automatically lose the hand. If the dealer busts, all players still in the hand win.

If both the player and dealer have a total of 17 or more, neither can take any further cards and the hand is said to be ‘pushed’, meaning no one wins or loses. In this case, any bets placed on either side are refunded.

The aim of Super 7 Blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The ace can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on what would help you get closest to 21 without going bust. The other cards are worth their face value. So for example, a 3 and an 8 would be worth 11 points in total (3 + 8 = 11).

As well as traditional blackjack betting options such as betting on whether you think the player will win or lose, Super 7 also offers side bets which allow you to bet on different combinations of hands such as whether both your first two card will be a pair, or if your first card will be an Ace etc

#  What is the minimum and maximum bet for Super 7 Blackjack?

#  What are the payouts for Super 7 Blackjack?

There is no definitive answer to this question as the payouts for Super 7 Blackjack can vary depending on the casino you choose to play at. However, most casinos offer payouts of between 97% and 99%, which is considerably higher than the payout rates for other variants of blackjack such as classic blackjack. This means that players have a greater chance of winning when playing Super 7 Blackjack, and therefore can stand to win bigger payouts.

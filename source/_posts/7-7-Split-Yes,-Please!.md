#  7-7 Split? Yes, Please!

Splitting your training into two halves is a great way to freshen up your routine and make continued progress.

There are endless debates on the internet about whether splitting your training into two halves is better than one big session, but the answer is pretty simple: it depends on what you’re trying to achieve.

If you’re looking to improve overall strength and size, then I would recommend staying with one big session. However, if you’re looking for improved performance and endurance, then splitting your training into two will definitely give you the results you’re looking for.

The main benefit of splitting your training is that it allows you to focus more intensely on each individual muscle group. When you train everything in one go, your muscles get only a brief period of rest between sets, which can lead to fatigue and reduced performance. Splitting your training allows you to rest longer between sets, which leads to increased performance and better results.

Another advantage of split training is that it allows you to do more volume with each muscle group. This can be especially beneficial for smaller muscle groups like the biceps and triceps, which can often be neglected when doing a full-body workout. By targeting these muscles more specifically, you can maximize their growth potential and achieve an impressive level of muscular development.

#  Why You Should Split Aces

In blackjack, splitting aces is usually not a good move. This is because you are only likely to get one more card for each ace, and since blackjack pays out 3 to 2 for a blackjack, you are usually better off taking just one card for each ace and waiting for a better hand.

However, there are some situations in which splitting aces can be profitable. For example, if the dealer is showing a low card, such as 2 or 3, you may want to split your aces in order to get two hands that have a better chance of beating the dealer's hand.

Another reason to split aces is if you have been lucky enough to draw two aces early in the game. In this case, splitting the aces will give you twice as many chances to get Blackjack and earn the high payout.

If you decide to split your aces, be sure to bet conservatively on each hand, since you are already at a disadvantage by splitting them in the first place.

#  When To Split Pairs In Blackjack 

Casino games offer ample opportunity for players to make money. In blackjack, for instance, there are specific times when players should split pairs.

Players should always split a pair of aces. When playing two aces, players receive two cards with the value of 1 each. A player's total is then 2. If the player is dealt another ace, the player has the option to take another card or split the aces. This gives the player four total cards with the value of 1 each and a total of 10. 

Players should also split a pair of 8s. When playing two eight cards, players receive two cards with the value of 8 each. A player's total is then 16. If the player is dealt another 8, the player has the option to take another card or split the 8s. This gives the player four total cards with the value of 8 each and a total of 24. 

Players should not split any other pairs besides aces and 8s.

#  The Best Times To Splits In Blackjack 

Blackjack is a casino game that involves playing against the dealer. The objective is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Players can either hit, stand, double down or split. Splitting is when a player divides their cards into two hands, instead of playing one hand. This can be advantageous in certain situations.

The best times to splits in blackjack are when you have:

-Two 8s 
-Two Aces 
-A 2 and a 3 
-A 3 and a 4 
-A 4 and a 5

When you have two 8s, splitting gives you the chance to win two hands rather than one. If the dealer has an Ace, it is likely that they will hit until they reach 21, which means you could lose both hands if you don't split. Splitting also gives you a better chance of drawing different cards that will help improve your hand. For example, if you have an 8 and an Ace, splitting will give you two chances of getting a card worth 10 points (10, J, Q, K).

With two Aces, splitting gives you the chance to have two separate hands with an Ace each. This can be very advantageous if the dealer has a low card (2 through 6). If the dealer hits on 16 or lower, they are likely to bust; this means you could win both hands if they hit. Another reason to split Aces is because many casinos offer special bonuses for getting blackjack with two Aces (a 2:1 payout).

When you have a 2 and a 3, splitting gives you better odds of winning than standing because it increases your chances of getting a 3 or higher card. For example, if you have a 3 and 4 and don't split them, then the only way to get 21 is if the dealer busts with their 7 or lower card. However, if you split them then there are three ways for you to get 21 (3+4=7; 3+3=6;4+2=6). If the dealer has a ten or an Ace showing (they are showing boxcars), then it is likely that they will draw another card that will give them 21. In this situation, splitting would not be advisable because your chances of winning are lower than if you just stood with your original hand.

When you have a 3 and 4, splitting also gives you the chance to win more money. If the dealer has anything other than an Ace showing (2 through 6), then they are likely to bust with their next card. This means that either one of your split hands will win or both will lose (assuming the dealer doesn't also bust). With two 5s or any other pair except for Aces and 8s, it is usually better to just stand with your original hand because your chances of winning are higher.

#  How To Play Your Splits In Blackjack

In blackjack, there are certain situations where it is advantageous to split your cards. For example, if you are dealt two aces, you can split them and play each card as if it were a separate hand. This will give you more chances to win compared to if you just played one ace.

There are other times when splitting is a good idea as well. For instance, if you are dealt two 10s, splitting them will give you two hands of 20 instead of just one hand of 20. In most cases, this will increase your chances of winning significantly.

However, there are also times when splitting is not a good idea. For example, if you are dealt two 6s, splitting them would give you two hands of 12 which is not nearly as good as having just one hand of 12. As a general rule, it is best to only split when the potential payout is worth the extra risk.

If you are ever unsure about whether or not to split your cards, consult the blackjack strategy chart. This will show you exactly when it is advantageous to split and when it is not.

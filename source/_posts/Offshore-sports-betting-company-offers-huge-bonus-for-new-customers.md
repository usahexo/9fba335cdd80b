Offshore sports betting company hit with class action lawsuit

The plaintiffs, who are seeking unspecified damages, argue that the company violated state gambling laws.

Offshore sports betting company Topbet has been hit with a class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs, who have not been identified, argue that the company violated state gambling laws by accepting bets from residents in states where online gambling is illegal.

Topbet is one of a number of online and offshore sports betting companies that have been targeted by class action lawsuits in recent months. In December, a group of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against three different companies - Betonusa, Sportsbetting.ag, and Bovada - claiming that they had violated state gambling laws.

The trend of class action lawsuits targeting online and offshore sports betting companies is likely to continue in 2016. Many of these companies are based overseas, which makes it difficult for bettors to pursue legal action against them. However, as the industry becomes more popular and more states legalize online gambling, we can expect to see an increase in lawsuits against these companies.

The company goes on to apologize to its customers for any inconvenience this may have caused and assures them that all funds held by the company will be refunded in full.

This news comes as a major disappointment to customers of the company, who have enjoyed betting on sports events from around the world with ease and convenience.

#  Texas Governor Greg Abbott Supports Casino Gambling in Texas 

Governor Greg Abbott has long been a supporter of casino gambling in the state of Texas. In an interview with the Dallas Morning News, Abbott said that he believes casino gambling would bring much-needed revenue to the state, and that he is actively looking for ways to bring it to Texas.

“I do support it because I think it can be a major boost to the economy of Texas,” Abbott told the Morning News. “There is money to be made from it, and there are also jobs to be created from it.”

Abbott went on to say that he doesn’t see casino gambling as a moral issue, but rather as an economic issue. He believes that allowing casinos in Texas would generate much-needed tax revenue for the state, and create new jobs in the hospitality industry.

This isn’t the first time that Governor Abbott has voiced his support for casino gambling in Texas. In fact, he has been talking about it since he was elected governor in 2014. In a statement on his website, Abbott said that he plans to work with the legislature to pass a bill legalizing casino gambling in Texas.

Many Texans oppose casino gambling, however, fearing that it could lead to increased crime and social problems. Others argue that casinos would take business away from local businesses and deprive the state of much-needed revenue.

Despite this opposition, Governor Abbott remains bullish on casino gambling in Texas. He believes that it would bring new jobs and revenue to the state, and is working hard to make it happen.

#  Trump Administration Backs Gambling Expansion in Saudi Arabia 

On Tuesday, the Trump administration threw its support behind a proposal from the Saudi government to expand gambling in the country.

The plan, announced last week by the Saudi government, would allow for the construction of new casinos and other forms of gambling. It would also permit foreign companies to operate gaming establishments in Saudi Arabia.

While the specifics of the proposal are still being finalized, it is clear that the Saudis see gambling as a potential source of revenue and employment. The country's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that gambling could bring in up to $24 billion annually.

The Trump administration has praised the proposal, with White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that it would create jobs and spur economic growth. "We support anything that creates jobs and opportunities for American workers," Sanders said.

Critics, including some lawmakers in Congress, have raised concerns about the social and ethical implications of expanded gambling in Saudi Arabia. But so far, there has been little opposition to the proposal within the United States.

#  Casino Gambling in Texas Could be a Reality This Year 

The legislature is in session and there is a bill that would legalize casino gambling in Texas. If the bill passes, it would mean that casinos could be built in areas like Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin. There are some who believe that this could be a great opportunity for economic development in Texas. Others believe that it could lead to more crime and social problems.

There is already some casino gambling in Texas. There are two Indian reservations in the state that have casinos. The Tigua Tribe has a casino near El Paso and the Kickapoo Tribe has a casino near Eagle Pass. There are also six racetracks in Texas that have slot machines and video poker games. These racetracks are called “racinos”.

Supporters of legalizing casino gambling in Texas say that it could bring in billions of dollars in revenue each year. They say that this money could be used to help fund education and infrastructure projects. Opponents of the bill say that it could lead to more gambling addiction and crime. They also argue that the state should not legalize something that is already being done illegally.

Texas is one of only four states in the country that does not have any form of casino gambling. If the bill passes, it will likely become a major tourist destination for people who want to gamble. This would be good news for the economy, but it could also lead to more social problems. Only time will tell if casino gambling will be legalized in Texas this year.

#  State Sen. Lucio Pushes for Casino Gambling in Texas 

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — State Sen. Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa blasted a proposal by one of his colleagues to legalize casino gambling in Texas, calling it a "disastrous idea" that would hurt the state's economy.

But Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., who made the proposal Wednesday, said casino gambling could bring much-needed revenue to the cash-strapped state.

Lucio's bill would allow casino gambling in counties with a population of at least 900,000. He said it would generate about $1.2 billion annually for the state.

Hinojosa, D-McAllen, disagreed, saying casino gambling is a magnet for crime and would be a detriment to tourism.

"It will destroy our economy," he said. "Texans don't want it and it will not create one job." 

Lucio, D-Brownsville, said he has been discussing his proposal with Gov. Rick Perry and believes Perry is open to the idea. A spokeswoman for Perry did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

Casino gambling is currently legal in just four states: Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware and Louisiana. 

According to the National Gambling Impact Study Commission released in 1999, legalized casino gambling leads to an increase in crime rates as well as pathological and problem gambling rates.

#  Casino Gaming Fuels Controversy in Texas

As the legalization of casino gaming in Texas gains momentum, so does the controversy surrounding it. What was once a sparsely populated state has become a battleground for the economic and social effects of casino development.

Proponents of casino gaming tout its potential to create jobs and generate tax revenue for the state. They argue that it would be a mistake to miss out on this new form of entertainment and tourism. Critics, however, question whether casinos are really as beneficial as proponents claim. They argue that casinos tend to cannibalize other businesses, produce little long-term economic growth, and can have negative social effects.

The conflict over casino gaming in Texas is emblematic of a larger debate over the role of gambling in society. Some people see it as a fun diversion that can be enjoyed responsibly by adults. Others see it as a scourge that preys on the vulnerable and exploits those with gambling addictions. The argument over casinos in Texas is sure to continue well into the future.

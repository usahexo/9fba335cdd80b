#  Mysterious blue hand discovered in casino fish tank!

A blue hand was discovered in the fish tank of a casino in Cádiz, southern Spain. José Manuel Fernández, who works at the casino, made the discovery on Tuesday morning. He told local newspaper Diario de Jerez that he saw "something strange" when he looked into the tank and that it took him a few minutes to realize that it was a human hand.

Police were called to the scene and cordoned off the area while they conducted an investigation. A forensic team removed the hand from the tank and took it for analysis. The results are not yet known, but police say that they do not believe that there is any criminal element to the discovery.

The hand is thought to have been dumped in the tank at some point between Sunday night and Monday morning. It is not clear how it got there or why it was discarded. Casino staff are said to be "very shocked" by the discovery.

#  What is that mysterious blue hand?

The blue hand is an iconic symbol of the Belgian city of Bruges. It is a statue of a left hand, made out of blue stone, that can be found near the Groeninge Museum. The hand was carved by sculptor Guido Gezelle in 1931.

According to legend, the hand belongs to a thief who was punished by being turned into stone. It is said that if you make a wish while touching the thumb of the hand, it will come true.

#  Casino staff stumped by blue hand in fish tank!

The blue hand has been baffling casino staff for the past few weeks. It was first spotted by a security guard who was on his rounds. He thought it was just a bit of fabric caught in the tank but when he took a closer look he realized that it was in fact a human hand.

Since then, the hand has been making its way around the casino. Staff have no idea where it came from or how it got into the tank. They've checked the security footage but there's no sign of anyone coming into the casino with a blue hand.

The fish in the tank have started to avoid the hand and some of them have even died from swimming too close to it. Casino staff are worried that they may have to get rid of the tank altogether if they can't find a way to remove the hand.

The mystery of the blue hand is attracting plenty of attention from tourists and locals alike. Some people are convinced that it's a sign from God while others think that it's a prank by someone working in the casino. No one knows for sure what's going on but everyone is keen to find out.

#  Glow in the dark hand found in Puerto Rico casino fish tank!

In a bizarre turn of events, a glow-in-the-dark hand was reportedly found by workers at the Caribbean Sea casino in Puerto Rico. The incident is said to have taken place earlier this week when employees were cleaning one of the fish tanks in the casino.

It’s still unclear how the hand got there and who it belongs to, but according to local reports, officials are currently investigating the matter. So far, no additional information has been released to the public.

This isn’t the first time something strange has been found in a fish tank. In 2014, for example, a diver discovered a dead body inside of an aquarium in Sydney, Australia. And just last year, a mannequin’s head was found inside a fish tank at a mosque in London.

While some people may find these discoveries unusual or even creepy, others see them as opportunities for learning and education. For example, when the dead body was discovered in Sydney, marine biologists were able to study the cause of death and learn more about how the environment affects aquatic life.

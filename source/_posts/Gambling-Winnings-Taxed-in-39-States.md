#  Taxing Gambling Winnings: Pros and Cons

Arguments For Taxing Gambling Winnings

1) Taxing gambling winnings would bring in much needed revenue for the government.

2) It is only fair that those who earn money from gambling should pay taxes on their winnings just like everyone else does.

Arguments Against Taxing Gambling Winnings

1) The government should not be getting involved in what people do with their own money.

2) Taxing gambling winnings would discourage people from participating in legal forms of gambling, which could lead to an increase in illegal gambling activities.

#  IRS to Start Taxing Gambling Winnings

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that it will start taxing gambling winnings in 2019. The new policy will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, slot machines, horse racing, and lotteries.

The IRS has long considered gambling income to be taxable, but this is the first time that the agency will specifically tax gambling winnings. Gambling losses can still be deducted from gambling winnings, but only up to the amount of taxable income.

The new policy is expected to generate an estimated $6 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. The revenue will help offset the costs of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Some taxpayers are unhappy with the new policy, arguing that it disproportionately affects low- and middle-income Americans. They argue that people who can afford to gamble should not get a tax break, while those who can't afford to gamble are forced to pay taxes on their winnings.

Others argue that the policy is fair because all income is taxable, regardless of where it was earned or how it was acquired. They also point out that the policy applies equally to all forms of gambling, including activities that are traditionally seen as more "legitimate" than others.

The IRS has yet to release final regulations regarding the taxation of gambling winnings, but taxpayers should start preparing for the change now. The best way to avoid surprises at tax time is to keep track of all your betting receipts and gaming logs. If you have questions about how the new policy applies to you, talk to a tax professional.
